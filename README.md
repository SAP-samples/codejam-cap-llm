# Expose capabilities of SAP AI Core with the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model

## Description

This repository contains the material for the "Expose SAP AI Core capabilities with the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model" CodeJam, which the SAP Developer Advocates brought to you.

## Overview

This CodeJam introduces attendees to aspects of exposing generative artificial intelligence (genAI) capabilities to execute tasks in a business context.

During this event, you'll become acquainted with the theory behind genAI and SAP AI Core and learn how to use the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model to expose AI capabilities through your own service application.

While working through the exercises, you'll become comfortable creating CDS-based service definitions and integrating them into the SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP) and SAP AI Core Foundation Models.

## Session prerequisites

Certain prerequisites must be sorted out before the day of the CodeJam in order to get the most from this CodeJam and work through the exercises.

The prerequisites are detailed in a separate [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) file. Please ensure you have everything ready before attending the CodeJam.

## Exercises

These are the exercises, each in their directory, sometimes with supporting files and scripts. We will work through the exercises in the order shown here. From a session flow perspective, we are taking the "coordinated" approach:

The instructor will start you on the first exercise, and that's the only one you should do. You should only proceed to the next exercise once the instructor tells you to.

## Feedback

If you can spare a couple of minutes at the end of the session, please provide feedback to help us improve next time.

Use this [Give feedback](https://github.com/SAP-samples/codejam-cap-llm/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=session-feedback-template.md&title=Session%20Feedback) link to create a special "feedback" issue, and follow the instructions in there.

Thank you!

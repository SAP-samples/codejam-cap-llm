# Prerequisites

These prerequisites are essential to a successful CodeJam. As an attendee, please ensure that you have worked through all of them and set things up before the day of the CodeJam event itself.

## Working environment

While there are many ways to work with the SAP Cloud Application Programming Model, with a wide choice of editors and command lines, we will use a primary environment, but also support an alternative. You must decide whether you want to use the primary environment or the alternative, and make sure you have the corresponding prerequisites set up accordingly.

The primary environment is a Dev Space in the SAP Business Application Studio. The alternative environment is VS Code with a dev container.

> The words "primary" and "alternative" are not meant to convey any superiority of one over the other.

Once you've decided on your environment, follow the corresponding subsection below to make sure you have what you need, and then continue working through any other prerequisites in this document.

### Primary environment: An SAP Business Application Studio Dev Space

For this CodeJam, you won't need to do anything to set up an instance of SAP Business Application Studio (BAS). We, as SAP, are providing an instance of BAS to you for the duration of this workshop. This instance will be torn down after the workshop so you won't be able to access it anymore. If you are interested in how you would create a BAS instance yourself, refer to the [btp-set-up-guide](./btp-setup-guide.md).

### Alternative environment: VS Code with a dev container

If you opt for the alternative environment, you'll need [Microsoft VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

You'll also need [git](https://git-scm.com/) to be able to clone this repository to your local filesystem to get started.

👉 Ensure you have VS Code, Docker Desktop and git available on your machine and that you have administrative access.

👉 Once you have VS Code, check that you have the Dev Containers extension - you can read about this and how to install it in this [Dev Containers tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/tutorial).
